# Hi, I’m Rad10head7!

## I am a Web Developer and an Open Source/New Tech enthusiast. I have a passion for Computer Science/Modern Tech and when I am not doing what I am 'best' at or what I get paid to do, I am usually teaching myself new cutting edge tech, contributing to open source code and blogs, and toying around with a few other computer hobbies I enjoy.

### These are some of the more common fields of work I do on a regular professional basis:
- Typescript/Javascript/Nodejs front-end and back-end Web Development
- Python small tool, Data Science and API Development
- Angular(js), React, Nextjs, Gatsby, Vue, Express, Jamstack Professional Development
- Rest API (Typescript, Python, PHP) and Graphql (Javascript) Development
- Event Driven, Reactive Functional, Object Oriented, Procedural Programming
- Linux Server Administration

### These are some of the fields I do as a hobby, contribute to open-source or just for fun:
- Cyber Security, Pen-testing
- Blockchain tech, theory and development
- AI mapping and Machine Learning
- Embedded Systems Programming
- Raspberry Pi tinkering and development
- Linux networking, kernel and Gnome/KDE environment upkeep

### When I am not hacking away on a keyboard, or being a fulltime husband and father, I have a few interests I hold in high regard:
- Sailing
- Backpacking
- Music (jazz, alternative rock, classical, romantic, baroque, impressionist, you know...elitist snob music haha)
- Space Travel and Astronomy
- Math, Chemistry, History, Science, reading, learning, and all nerdy and fascinating things of the like
- building and playing on musical instruments, amplifiers and analog/digital electronic effects of my own amateur design
